A,sorkun2019a,6110,OECD2019,OECD,open,14180,6110,"name, CAS ","g/L, mg/L, ug/L ",1,1,1,1,"Dataset A was obtained from eChemPortal14, which is an open source chemical property database developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Solubility data was extracted after applying the filters “experimental studies” and “water solubility”. This yielded several lines of bulk text which were then parsed to obtain CAS number, name, and experimental results on sol- ubility including temperature and pH conditions. A total of 14,180 instances were thus obtained and these were further filtered by temperature for a range between 25 ± 5 °C. After filtering, 8,419 instances were obtained. In the identifier generation step, 6,183 of 8,419 compounds were successfully converted into SMILES. Finally, after applying SMILES validation 6,110 instances were obtained"
B,sorkun2019a,4651,EnvironmentalProtectionAgency1995,EPA,open,5764,4651,"name, CAS",LogS ,1,1,0,0,"Dataset B was downloaded from EPI Suite Data website15. This open-source dataset consisted of 5,764 liquid and crystalline organic compounds with the following properties: CAS number, name, molecular weight, water solubility, temperature. SMILES identifiers were successfully generated for 5,367 of these compounds. After that, we filtered the data by temperature between 25 ± 5 °C to obtain 5,206 compounds. In the final step, the InChI and InChIKey were validated to obtain 4,651 compounds."
C,sorkun2019a,2603,Raevsky2014,,open,2603,2603,"name, SMILES ",LogS ,0,1,1,0,"Dataset C was collected from the work of Raevsky et al.16 and it contains solubility data measured at 25 ± 5 °C. The dataset consists of solubility of 2,603 crystalline solid compounds along with SMILES strings. All compounds were successfully recreated after pre-processing steps."
D,sorkun2019a,2115,Pence2012,,open,2267,2115,"name, CAS",LogS,0,1,0,0,"Dataset D was downloaded from EPI Suite Data website17. This open-source data- set consisted of 2,267 liquid and crystalline organic compounds, out of which 2,115 compounds remained after applying the pre-processing steps."
E,sorkun2019a,1291,USEnvironmentalProtectionAgency1994,EPA,open,1291,1291,"name, SMILES, CAS",LogS ,1,1,1,0,"Dataset E was taken from the work of Huuskonen et al.1. In this study, the experi- mental aqueous solubility value measured between 20–25 °C were obtained from the AQUASOL database of the University of Arizona and SCR’s PHYSPROP Database. The extended version of this dataset with 1,291 solubility values and SMILES was downloaded from the Cheminformatics (http://cheminformatics.org/). All compounds were successfully recreated after pre-processing steps"
F,sorkun2019a,1210,Wang2009,Beilstein_Reaxys,open,1210,1210,SLN,LogS,1,1,0,0,"Dataset F was taken from the work of Wang et al.8. They extracted 1,210 compounds from the Beilstein database and sanitized it. However, the dataset contains compound identifiers in only the SLN format12. We converted SLN to SMILES representation using RDKit SLN parser. During the conversion 93 of 1,210 compounds could not be produced. Using Molview (http://molview.org/) web tool, we obtained valid SMILES for 93 missing compounds. Name information was collected from NCI Chemical Identifier Resolver service, Molview and SpyderChem18 websites. InChI and InChIKey values are produced and validated using the pre-processing steps and all compounds were successfully recreated."
G,sorkun2019a,1144,Delaney2004,ESOL,open,1144,1144,"name, SMILES ",LogS ,1,1,0,0,"Dataset G was taken from the work of Delaney et al.2. The dataset consists of 1,144 small compounds with experimental solubility measured at 25 °C and SMILES information. All compounds were successfully recreated after applying the pre-processing steps."
H,sorkun2019a,578,Wang2009,Jain2001,open,578,578,SLN,LogS,1,1,1,0,"Dataset H was taken from the work of Wang et al.8, who sanitized the dataset used by Jain and Yalkowsky by removing duplicate entries19. This dataset consists of 322 liquid and 256 solid compounds. The dataset contained only SLN as the compound identifiers and after applying the pre-processing steps all com- pounds are successfully recreated."
I,sorkun2019a,94,Llinas2008,,open,105,94,"name, SMILES, InChI",uM,0,1,0,0,"Dataset I was taken from the Goodman Group website (http://www-jmg.ch.cam.ac.uk/ data/solubility/) as the corrected version of solubility challenge20. The dataset consists of 105 drug-like com- pounds with name, SMILES, and solubility information. The solubility values were measured at 25 °C. 11 of 105 crystalline data had to be removed because their solubility values were missing. All compounds were successfully recreated after applying the pre-processing steps."
